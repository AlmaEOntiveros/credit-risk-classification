# credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called credit-risk-classification. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your credit-risk-classification repository, create a folder titled "Credit_Risk."

Inside the "Credit_Risk" folder, add the credit_risk_classification.ipynb and lending_data.csv files found in the "Starter_Code.zip" file.

Push your changes to GitHub.
